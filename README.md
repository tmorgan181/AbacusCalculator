# AbacusCalculator
This program simulates the addition of two numbers using an abacus. It takes two decimal numbers having up to 12 digits each as inputs, "loads" each onto a digital abacus, and prints an ASCII representation of each abacus. The sum is then taken by adding the values of each rod on both abacuses, properly handling any carry that occurs. The result is then printed as an ASCII abacus.


Included JPEG files are example sums.
